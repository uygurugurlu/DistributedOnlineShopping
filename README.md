# DistributedOnlineShopping

This project calculates the shortest distance between two nodes in a directed graph using scala language in order to calculate an optimal route for online shopping deliveries.

The goal is that when multiple orders came in a short amount of time, according to the error tolerance value, the deliveries of these orders are made at once by the shortest distance algorith.
